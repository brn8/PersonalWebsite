          I arrived in the United States in 2010, fulfilling a dream shared by
          many who view this country as the land of opportunity. My journey
          began when I started 7th grade here, which came with its own set of
          challenges. Learning English was initially difficult, and adjusting to
          a new culture and education system was intimidating. However, as time
          passed, I adapted, improving my language skills and embracing my new
          environment.

          I graduated from William L. Dickinson High School, an experience that
          strengthened my academic foundation and helped me develop a passion
          for technology. This led me to pursue a degree in computer science. I
          began my college journey at Montclair State University, where I spent
          two years honing my technical skills and building a strong academic
          background. Later, I transferred to the New Jersey Institute of
          Technology (NJIT), where I completed my degree in 2021. My time at
          NJIT was transformative, allowing me to dive deeper into computer
          science, explore specialized areas, and prepare myself for a career in
          technology.

          Beyond academics, I have a deep love for sports, which has always been
          a big part of my life. I enjoy both watching and playing sports,
          especially basketball, cricket, baseball, football, and carrom. Sports
          have taught me invaluable lessons in teamwork, discipline, and
          perseverance, which I carry with me in all aspects of my life.
